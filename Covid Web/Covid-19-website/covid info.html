        <h1 data-aos="zoom-in-left">What is Covid-19</h1>
        <p data-aos="fade-right">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered
            coronavirus.
            <br>
            <br>
            Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and
            recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like
            cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious
            illness.
            <br>
            <br>
            The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the
            disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or
            using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.
            <br>
            <br>
            The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected
            person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by
            coughing into a flexed elbow)</p>

        <h1 data-aos="fade-up-left" class=home-h1>Protect yourself and others from COVID-19</h1>
        <p data-aos="fade-right">If COVID-19 is spreading in your community, stay safe by taking some simple
            precautions, such as physical
            distancing, wearing a mask, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds, cleaning your hands, and
            coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. Check local advice where you live and work. Do it all!</p>

        <p data-aos="fade-right">Protect yourself and others around you by knowing the facts and taking appropriate
            precautions. Follow advice
            provided by your local health authority.</p>
        <li data-aos="fade-right">Wash your hands regularly with soap and water, or clean them with alcohol-based hand
            rub. Maintain at least
            1 metre distance between you and people coughing or sneezing.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-right">Avoid touching your face.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-right">Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-right">Stay home if you feel unwell.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-right">Refrain from smoking and other activities that weaken the lungs.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-right">Practice physical distancing by avoiding unnecessary travel and staying away from
            large groups of people.
        </li>
        <p data-aos="fade-right">Calling in advance allows your healthcare provider to quickly direct you to the right
            health facility. This
            protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.</p>
        <h1 data-aos="fade-up-left">Mask</h1>
        <p data-aos="fade-right">Masks
            Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others. Masks alone do
            not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow the
            advice provided by your local health authority.</p>

    <section class="section" id="section2">
        <h1 data-aos="fade-up-left" class="home-h1">What to do to keep yourself and others safe from COVID-19</h1>
        <li data-aos="fade-right">Maintain at least a 1-metre distance between yourself and others to reduce your risk
            of infection when
            they
            cough, sneeze or speak. Maintain an even greater distance between yourself and others when indoors. The
            further away, the better.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-right">Make wearing a mask a normal part of being around other people. The appropriate use,
            storage and
            cleaning or
            disposal are essential to make masks as effective as possible.</li>
        <h2 data-aos="fade-left">Here are the basics of how to wear a mask:</h2>

        <li data-aos="fade-right">Clean your hands before you put your mask on, as well as before and after you take it
            off, and after you
            touch it at any time.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-right">Make sure it covers both your nose, mouth and chin.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-right">When you take off a mask, store it in a clean plastic bag, and every day either wash
            it if it’s a fabric
            mask, or dispose of a medical mask in a trash bin.
            Don’t use masks with valves.</li>

        <h1 data-aos="fade-up-left" class="home-h1">How to make your environment safer</h1>

        <h2 data-aos="fade-left" class="home-h2">Avoid the 3Cs: spaces that are closed, crowded or involve close
            contact.</h2>
        <li data-aos="fade-right">Outbreaks have been reported in restaurants, choir practices, fitness classes,
            nightclubs, offices and
            places of worship where people have gathered, often in crowded indoor settings where they talk loudly,
            shout, breathe heavily or sing.</li>
        <li data-aos="fade-right">The risks of getting COVID-19 are higher in crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces
            where infected
            people
            spend long periods of time together in close proximity. These environments are where the virus appears
            to
            spread by respiratory droplets or aerosols more efficiently, so taking precautions is even more
            important.
        </li>

        <h2 data-aos="fade-left" class="home-h2">void crowded or indoor settings but if you can’t, then take
            precautions:</h2>

        <h1 data-aos="fade-up-left">Symptoms of COVID-19</h1>
        <P data-aos="zoom-in-right">Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, ranging from mild symptoms to severe
            illness.Common symptoms include
            headache,loss of smelland taste,nasal congestion and runny nose, cough, muscle pain, sore throat, fever,
            diarrhea, and breathing difficulties.People with the same infection may have different symptoms, and their
            symptoms may change over time. Three common clusters of symptoms have been identified: one respiratory
            symptom cluster with cough, sputum, shortness of breath, and fever; a musculoskeletal symptom cluster with
            muscle and joint pain, headache, and fatigue; a cluster of digestive symptoms with abdominal pain, vomiting,
            and diarrhea.In people without prior ear, nose, and throat disorders, loss of taste combined with loss of
            smell is associated with COVID-19.
            Of people who show symptoms, 81% develop only mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), while 14%
            develop severe symptoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging) and 5% of patients
            suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction). At least a third of the
            people who are infected with the virus do not develop noticeable symptoms at any point in time. These
            asymptomatic carriers tend not to get tested and can spread the disease.Other infected people will develop
            symptoms later, called "pre-symptomatic", or have very mild symptoms and can also spread the virus.</P>
        <P data-aos="zoom-in-left">As is common with infections, there is a delay between the moment a person first
            becomes infected and the
            appearance of the first symptoms. The median delay for COVID-19 is four to five days. Most symptomatic
            people experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all will experience at least
            one symptom within 12 days.</P>
        <P data-aos="zoom-in-right">Most people recover from the acute phase of the disease. However, some people
            continue to experience a range
            of effects for months after recovery—named long COVID—and damage to organs has been observed. Multi-year
            studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.</P>
